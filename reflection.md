Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
It makes more work :(( However, I also remember from saome previous projects that it is in my best intersts not to modify the variables from another class. So, now i have more positive feelings about it than I previously did. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Initally, I got confused with the couple of method types and names. Amidst that, everything worked.
Please name the methods differently and properly because in this assignment there so many of them, so if you not name them properly you will be very confused. Don't be scared of long names for your methods and variables; just make sure they are clear what they represent.
